# Urban Eye 3D – JOSM 3D Viewer Plugin

**Urban Eye 3D** is a JOSM plugin that provides a dedicated 3D view (dockable or floating) to visualize loaded buildings and building parts (`building=*` and `building:part=*`).

## Benefits for Mappers

While 3D visualization of OSM data has existed for years through external tools, the absence of a dedicated 3D viewer within JOSM (particularly since the discontinuation of [Kenzi 3D](https://github.com/kendzi/kendzi3d)) has been a notable gap. 

Urban Eye 3D solves this problem! Mappers and 3D building enthusiasts can now preview their edits directly within JOSM before uploading data to OpenStreetMap.

## Key Features
* Supports the [Simple 3D Buildings](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Simple_3D_Buildings) specification
* Visualizes loaded buildings/parts only – no editing or export functionality
* Intuitive navigation:  
  - Orbit (left mouse drag)  
  - Zoom (mouse wheel)
  - Pan (right mouse drag)
* Basic color support for `building:colour` and `roof:colour` tags
* Real-time updates: Changes made in JOSM instantly reflect in the 3D view
